http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography

Algorithms to steganography files into images.

The concept is easy and creative: get the data from the file, convert to base64, compact and convert to hexadecimal values, so get each three chunks of hexa values to compose the image that trully represents the data file.
