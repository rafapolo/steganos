Steganos
=======

The concept is easy and creative: get the data from the file, encode into base64, compact and encode into hexadecimal values, so get each three chunks of hexa values to compose the pixels colors that represents the file as an encoded PNG image so you can reverse and decode it later as the original file.

This was a prove of concept so I could upload 6GB of videos and PDFs to Flickr as images.
